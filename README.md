# RabbitMQ Federation Management Plugin

This plugin adds information on federation link status to the management
plugin.


## Installation

In recent releases, this plugin ships with RabbitMQ. Enable it with

    rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management rabbitmq_federation_management

If you have a heterogenous cluster (where the nodes have different
plugins installed), this should be installed on the same nodes as the
management plugin.


## Use over HTTP API

The HTTP API endpoints allow for retrieval of federation links:

    # lists all links
    GET /api/federation-links
    # lists links in a vhost
    GET /api/federation-links/{vhost}


## Building From Source

To [build the plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html), use

    make dist

and see under the `./plugins` directory.
